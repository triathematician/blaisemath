/**
 * <p>
 *   Represents the semantic tree which can be used to actually <i>calculate</i>
 *   values. The primary method retrieves the <i>value</i> of the tree, assuming
 *   it can be calculated, as a class of type <code>getValueType()</code>. Secondary methods
 *   allow for retrieving all <i>variables</i> within the tree and returning the types
 *   of the immediate children of the node (called <i>parameters</i>).
 * </p>
 *  <ul>
 *  <li> The <b>value</b> of a node is the object that the
 *   node returns, possibly a numeric or boolean value or a string, or anything really.</li>
 *  <li> The <b>parameters</b> of a node are the <i>children</i> of the <code>TreeNode</code>
 *   interface or the "subnodes"; the <b>parameter types</b> are the class types that
 *   are expected of the arguments.</li>
 *  <li> Finally, the <b>variables</b> are the list of nodes in the
 *   tree with unknown values, identified by names and returned as a table.</li>
