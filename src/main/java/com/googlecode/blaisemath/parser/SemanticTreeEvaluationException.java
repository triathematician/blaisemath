 *    This exception is generated when a semantic tree cannot be completely evaluated.
 *    This might happen, for example, when one of the nodes in the tree is a variable
 *    without a value, or when one of the nodes is an unrecognized function token,
 *    or when the actual evaluation contains a numerical error (e.g. divide by zero).
