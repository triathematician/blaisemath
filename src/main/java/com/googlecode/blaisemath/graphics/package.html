            This library manages graphic objects, and swing displays for trees of
            graphic objects. It also provides support for customizing graphic object
            styles.
        </p>
        <h1>Threads and Concurrency</h1>
        <p>
            As with the swing library, the graphics tree is assumed to be managed
            from within a single thread, usually the swing event-dispatch thread.
            Some support is provided for two other threads that may be created
            using {@code BlaiseCommon} classes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                {@code com.googlecode.blaisemath.coordinate.CoordinateManager}
                is used to manage locations of sets of points in a few classes.
                If other threads modify the coordinates, changes to the relevant
                graphic objects are made only on the EDT.
            </li>
            <li>
                {@code com.googlecode.blaisemath.util.animation.AnimationStep}
                is used for some zooming animations within
                {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.swing.PanAndZoomHandler}.
                The animation is triggered on a background thread, but changes are
                made on the EDT.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
