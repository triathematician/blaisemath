/**
 * <p>
 *   <code>MPropertyEditorSupport</code> extends the basic property editor to
 *   improve handling of events. Maintains a temporary <code>newValue</code> object that
 *   tracks changes by the editor. These changes will pass events to any interested
 *   listeners if adjusted through the <code>setNewValue</code> method rather than directly.
 *   An interested bean can then check the "newValue" to see what has changed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   The <code>cancelEditAction()</code> and <code>stopEditAction()</code> methods will
 *   either reset the editor to the initial state, or make a permanent change to the
 *   initial value. In both cases, an event may be fired to indicate that the external
 *   value has changed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Registered listeners hear when the new value is changed somehow. If interested
 *   in updating constantly, they should look to the <code>getNewValue()</code> method.
 *   If only interested in the final value, they should update only when the <code>getValue()</code>
 *   method returns a different value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   External changes, e.g. to the underlying bean, should be handled by invoking the
 *   <code>setValue</code> method here. This calls the <code>initEditorValue</code>
 *   method to set up the editor based on some external value.
 * </p>
