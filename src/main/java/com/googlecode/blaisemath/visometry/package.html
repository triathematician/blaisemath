          The {@code specto} package is the root package for visual components
          within the larger <em>blaise</em> library. Key components are 
          {@link org.bm.blaise.specto.graphics.Visometry}, which handles
          coordinate transformations between a display window and an underlying
          geometry, {@link org.bm.blaise.specto.graphics.VGraphic}, which is the
          the core graphic primitive defined in local coordinates,
          {@link org.bm.blaise.specto.Plottable}, which is a generic component
          that can be translated into one or more {@code VGraphic} objects, and
          finally {@link org.bm.blaise.specto.graphics.VGraphicComponent} and
          {@link org.bm.blaise.specto.PlotComponent}, which display collections
          of {@code VGraphic}s and {@code Plottable}s, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
          This package strongly parallels the {@code org.bm.blaise.specto.graphics} package
          in <code>BlaiseGraphics</code>, with the addition of a {@link org.bm.blaise.specto.graphics.Visometry}
          to handle coordinate transformation from object coordinates to screen coordinates.
      </p>
      <p>
          This vastly simplifies defining elements within the various geometries. Instead of worrying
          about the steps for conversion, the plottable elements can just create the graphic primitives
          in their local coordinate system.
