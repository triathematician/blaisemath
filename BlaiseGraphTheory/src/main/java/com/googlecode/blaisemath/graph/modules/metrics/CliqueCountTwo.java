 * Computes the clique count of a particular vertex,
 * i.e. the number of connections between edges in the neighborhood
 * of the vertex, not counting the edges adjacent to the vertex itself.
 * Current computation time is linear in the # of edges in the graph (vertex case),
 * and quadratic in the map case (linear in edges * linear in vertices).
