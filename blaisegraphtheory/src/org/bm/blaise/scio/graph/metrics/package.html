    <title>Graph Theory Metrics Package (org.bm.blaise.scio.graph.metrics)</title>

      <p>
          This package contains special-purpose utility methods for computing metrics
          associated with graphs, such as centrality metrics.
      </p>
      <p>
          Most metrics are subclassed from <code>NodeMetric</code>, which provides a method
          for getting the value of a metric at a single node, and a method for getting the values
          of a metric for all nodes. If metrics do not depend upon parameters, generally
          their class will have a <code>getInstance()</code> method returning a singleton instance
          of the metric.
      </p>
      <p>
          The <code>subset</code> subpackage provides classes for metrics that are defined
          for more than one node, as well as special implementations <code>AdditiveSubsetMetric</code>
          and <code>ContractiveSubsetMetric</code> that are derived from single-vertex metrics.
