          Provides swing components for rendering {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.Graphic}
          objects.
      </p>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>The Graphics Component and the Graphics Tree</h3>
      <p>
          {@link org.blaise.graphics.GraphicComponent} is the top-level swing component, 
          and works primarily with two classes: 
          a {@link org.blaise.graphics.GraphicRoot} and a {@link org.blaise.style.StyleContext}.
          As might be expected, the first is responsible for storing the shapes and the
          second for drawing the shapes. However, the shapes stored in the {@code GraphicRoot}
          may also provide their own style information.
          Shapes within the {@code GraphicRoot} are stored as 
          {@link org.blaise.graphics.Graphic}s.
