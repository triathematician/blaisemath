      <p>
          Provides swing components for rendering {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.Graphic}
          objects.
      </p>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>The Graphics Component and the Graphics Tree</h3>
      <p>
          {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.swing.JGraphicComponent} is the top-level swing component, 
          and works primarily with two classes: 
          a {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.swing.JGraphicRoot} and a
          {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.style.StyleContext}.
          As might be expected, the first is responsible for storing the shapes and the
          second for drawing the shapes. However, the shapes stored in the {@code GraphicRoot}
          may also provide their own style information.
          Shapes within the {@code GraphicRoot} are stored as 
          {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.core.Graphic}s.
      </p>
      <h2>Mouse Handling</h2>
      <p>
          Mouse events are delegated through the graphics tree, in addition to being
          handled at the component level. When passed to graphics, the mouse events
          are enlarged to include the local coordinate.
          The following mouse handlers are available:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.swing.PanAndZoomHandler}
              - <b>pans and zooms canvs</b>, using the mouse wheel or drawing a box
              (installed on a {@link JGraphicComponent} by invoking {@code PanAndZoomHandler.install()})
          </li>
          <li>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.swing.JGraphicSelectionHandler}
              - enables <b>selecting graphics</b> in various ways, including clicks with control
              keys and dragging a box; also toggles selection highlighting
              (installed by default with every {@code JGraphicComponent}, but only
              handles selection events if the {@code selectionEnabled} flag on the component
              is set to true)
          </li>
          <li>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.swing.JGraphicRoot$MouseHandler} (private class)
              - <b>delegates mouse events to graphics</b>, maintains references to the
              current mouse location and current graphic under the mouse
              (installed by default with {@code JGraphicRoot})
          </li>
          
          <li>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.swing.HighlightOnMouseoverHandler}
              - <b>highlights graphics</b> when the mouse moves over them
              (installed by default with every {@code Graphic})
          </li>
          
          <li>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.core.GraphicMoveHandler} 
              - enables <b>moving graphics</b> by dragging
              (installed for instances of {@code PrimitiveGraphicSupport} when the
              primitive is a {@code Point2D} and {@code setDragEnabled(true)} is invoked)
          </li>
          <li>{@code ShapeDragHandler} (private class)
              - enables <b>moving graphics</b> by dragging
              (installed for instances of {@code PrimitiveGraphicSupport} when the
              primitive is a {@code Point2D} and {@code setDragEnabled(true)} is invoked)
          </li>
          <li>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.core.BasicPointSetGraphic$IndexedPointMover}
              - enables <b>moving individual points</b> in a {@code BasicPointSetGraphic}
              (installed by default on this graphic)
          </li>
      </ul>
