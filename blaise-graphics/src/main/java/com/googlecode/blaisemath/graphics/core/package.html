      <p>
          Provides components for building trees of graphics that can be rendered
          on a target canvas. The graphics API includes support for several
          interactive capabilities, including custom styles, tooltips, selection,
          highlighting, and context menus.
      </p>
      <p>
          This package contains the core definitions of
          {@code Graphic} and {@code GraphicComposite}, along with several
          implementations of graphics and supporting capabilities. The {@code swing}
          package contains the logic for rendering graphic trees on a target canvas.
      </p>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>The Graphics Component and the Graphics Tree</h3>
      <p>
          {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.swing.JGraphicComponent} is the top-level swing component, 
          and works primarily with two classes: 
          a {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.GraphicRoot} and a {@link org.blaise.style.StyleContext}.
          As might be expected, the first is responsible for storing the shapes and the
          second for drawing the shapes. However, the shapes stored in the {@code GraphicRoot}
          may also provide their own style information.
          Shapes within the {@code GraphicRoot} are stored as 
          {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.Graphic}s, comprised of:
      </p>
      <ol>
          <li>the graphic object and a means to draw it (in the form of a {@code contains} method and a {@code draw} method),</li>
          <li>a parent for that shape, and </li>
          <li>a tooltip for the shape (parametrized by point),</li>
          <li>a mouse listener for the shape (parametrized by point),</li>
          <li>visibility status ({@link org.blaise.style.VisibilityHint}).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
          The {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.GraphicRoot} maintains the shapes that are to be drawn, including both
          the shapes themselves and the order in which they are drawn. This object also listens to
          mouse events from the {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.GraphicComponent}, which it passes along as a
          {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.GraphicMouseEvent} to the top-most {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.Graphic}
          (in terms of draw order) whose parent is a {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.GraphicMouseListener}.
      </p>
      <h3>Specific Graphics</h3>
      <p>
          Implementing {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.Graphic} should be straightforward.
          {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.GraphicSupport} contains much of the code
          required, apart from the {@code draw} and {@code contains} methods.
          {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.GraphicComposite} groups together several
          {@code Graphic}s, and also has an overridable {@link org.blaise.style.StyleContext},
          which can be used to set a default style for its constituents.
          {@code Graphic}s are typically implemented in one of two ways: either with
          concrete styles, or with styles that are chosen/generated as the
          object is drawn, depending on a "source object". The first are labeled
          by "{@code Basic}" and the second by "{@code Delegating}".
      </p>
      <p>
          Within the package, a few specific {@code Graphic}s
          are implemented, as described in the table below:
      </p>
      <table>
          <thead>
              <tr>
                  <th>Class Name</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
              <tr>
                  <td>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.BasicPointGraphic}</td>
                  <td>A draggable point, rendered by a {@link org.blaise.style.PointStyle}</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.BasicPointSetGraphic}</td>
                  <td>Several points, rendered by a common {@link org.blaise.style.PointStyle}</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.BasicShapeGraphic}</td>
                  <td>An arbitrary shape or path, rendered by a common
                      {@link org.blaise.style.ShapeStyle} or
                      {@link org.blaise.style.PathStyle}
                  </td>
              </tr>   
              <tr>
                  <td>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.BasicStringGraphic}</td>
                  <td>A string located at a point on the graphics canvas, rendered by a
                      {@link org.blaise.style.StringStyle}
                  </td>
              </tr>     
              <tr>
                  <td>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graphics.CustomPointSetGraphic}</td>
                  <td>Several points, with references to source objects, rendered
                      by a {@link org.blaise.style.PointStyle} delegate.
                  </td>
              </tr>        
          </tbody>
      </table>
