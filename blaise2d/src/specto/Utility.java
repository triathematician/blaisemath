     * so that in looking at the plot the arrows aren't too long or too short. Something aesthetically pleasing and demonstrative of the important qualities of
     * the data.
     * 
     * Another thing... I want to be able to automatically determine optimal plot scales, so that plotting a function adjusts the scale automatically, perhaps not
     * including all of the data set in order to capture the more important parts of the data set.
     * 
     * It seems likely that in the latter task a log scale may be more appropriate to consider the true scale of the data. For example, when plotting x^3-3x between
     * -10 and 10, it seems best to limit the y-axis scale somewhat... otherwise the minima are lost in the big picture. Not really important, but something to work
     * toward.
