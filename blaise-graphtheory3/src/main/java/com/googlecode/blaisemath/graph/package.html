    <title>Graph Theory Package (org.bm.blaise.scio.graph)</title>
    <body>
      <p>
          This package contains the primary classes for graphs, including interfaces
          and default implementations. The main interface is <code>Graph</code>, providing
          the standard API for working with graphs. The two most important implementations are
          <code>SparseGraph</code>, where the edges are encoded using lists, and <code>MatrixGraph</code>,
          where the edges are encoded using arrays.
      </p>
      <p>
          Standard graphs may be constructed using the methods in <code>GraphFactory</code>, and standard
          algortihms are contained in the <code>Graphs</code> class. Secondary classes can be used to generate
          other kinds of graphs: see <code>RandomGraph</code>, <code>DegreeRandomGraph</code>,
          <code>WattsStrogatzRandomGraph</code>, and <code>PreferentialAttachment</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
          <code>ContractedGraph</code> and <code>Subgraph</code> generate new graphs based on old ones by
          either contracting all nodes in a subset to a single node (in the first case), or by focusing only
          on a subset of nodes (in the second case).
      </p>
      <p>
          Secondary interfaces include <code>ValuedGraph</code> (vertices have associated values) and
          <code>WeightedGraph</code> (edges have associated values). Each of these
          interfaces has implementations as "wrappers" <code>ValuedGraphWrapper</code>,
          <code>WeightedGraphWrapper</code>, and <code>WeightedValuedGraphWrapper</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
          <i>Longitudinal graphs</i> are supported with the <code>LongitudinalGraph</code> interface,
          which provides a time domain, and each time within the domain gives a different "slice".
          There are two implementations of this: <code>ListLongitudinalGraph</code>, suitable for
          a list of graphs which occur at discrete times, and <code>IntervalLongitudinalGraph</code>,
          where a single graph is specified, and vertices/edges each have their own time domains.
      </p>
      <p>
          Two kinds of layouts are supported: <i>static</i> and <i>iterative</i>. Static layout methods
          are described by the <code>StaticGraphLayout</code> interface, and iterative layouts
          by the <code>IterativeGraphLayout</code> interface. The static interface contains a single
          <code>layout</code> method which returns computed positions of a graph's nodes (with optional
          parameters). The iterative interface contains a <code>reset</code> method, an <code>iterate</code>
          method, and a <code>getPoints</code> method.
      </p>
      <h1>Multi-threading</h1>
      <p>
          New threads are created by {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graph.layout.GraphLayoutManager}
          and {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graph.view.LongitudinalGraphManager},
          both for executing layout algorithms in background threads. In part to
          support this, the following classes are designed to be thread-safe:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graph.modules.layout.SpringLayout}</li>
          <li>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graph.longitudinal.SimultaneousLayout}</li>
          <li>{@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graph.GAInstrument}</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          Any new implementation of {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.graph.IterativeGraphLayout}
          should also be thread-safe, given its usage by {@code GraphLayoutManager}.
      </p>
