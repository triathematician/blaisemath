          The {@code specto} package is the root package for visual components
          within the larger <em>blaise</em> library. Key components are 
          {@link org.bm.blaise.specto.graphics.Visometry}, which handles
          coordinate transformations between a display window and an underlying
          geometry, {@link org.bm.blaise.specto.graphics.VGraphic}, which is the
          the core graphic primitive defined in local coordinates,
          {@link org.bm.blaise.specto.Plottable}, which is a generic component
          that can be translated into one or more {@code VGraphic} objects, and
          finally {@link org.bm.blaise.specto.graphics.VGraphicComponent} and
          {@link org.bm.blaise.specto.PlotComponent}, which display collections
          of {@code VGraphic}s and {@code Plottable}s, respectively.
