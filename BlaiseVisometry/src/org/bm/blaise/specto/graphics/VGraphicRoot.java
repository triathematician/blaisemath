/**
 * <p>
 *      Adds additional {@link Visometry} (local coordinates) support to the parent {@link GraphicRoot}.
 *      Functionally, this class behaves differently than {@code GraphicRoot}. It maintains the {@code Visometry},
 *      as well as the {@link VisometryProcessor} used to convert entries from local coordinates to view coordinates.
 *      It also maintains the {@link PlottableComposite}, which is another tree of plottable elements that can be
 *      <em>recomputed</em>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *      So in all, there are three trees maintained by this class:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *      <li>the {@link Graphic} tree maintained by the parent {@link GraphicRoot};</li>
 *      <li>the {@link VGraphic} tree maintained within the {@link PlottableComposite};</li>
 *      <li>the {@link Plottable} tree maintained within the {@link PlottableComposite}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 *      The {@code Plottable} maintains the generic source object, and has the logic to generate one or more {@code VGraphic}s.
 *      Passing from the {@code Plottable} to the {@code VGraphic} requires <em>recomputation</em> 
 *          (see {@link Plottable#recompute()} and {@link Plottable#getGraphicEntry()}).
 *      The {@code VGraphic} maintains a graphics primitive in local coordinates.
 *      Passing from the {@code VGraphic} to the {@code Graphic} requires <em>reconversion</em> 
 *          (see {@link VGraphic#setUnconverted(boolean)} and {@link VGraphic#getWindowEntry()}).
 *      The conversion step is completed with the help of the {@code Visometry} and the {@code VisometryProcessor}.
 *      Both the computation and conversion steps are currently completed within
 *      the {@link VGraphicComponent#renderTo(java.awt.Graphics2D)} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *      While in some cases, the duplication of objects may be inefficient, 
 *      it allows certain things to be done without expensive recomputation.
 *      This is particularly true when the recomputation steps or conversion steps
 *      take a substantial amount of time, or it makes sense to separate them.
 *      For example, a 3D visometry would maintain 3D graphics primitives, which would
 *      NOT need to be recomputed whenever the view changes. In the above language,
 *      the 3D primitives comprise the {@code VGraphic}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *      The separation between {@code Graphic} and {@code VGraphic} also allows for
 *      customizing or manipulating the draw order of the graphics primitives,
 *      which is also important for 3D graphics.
 * </p>
