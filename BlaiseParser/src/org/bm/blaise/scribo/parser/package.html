        This package contains functionality to recognize "tokens" of various type in
        a String input, and to convert them into a <code>SemanticNode</code>, which
        has functionality similar to a method.
    </p>
    <p>
        Errors in input are handled by the <code>ParseException</code> class.
    </p>
    <p>
        Extensibility is handled primarily by the <code>Grammar</code> interface, which
        is used by the tokenizer to determine the types of tokens corresponding to
        different symbols. Currently supported grammars are the <i>BooleanGrammar</i> and
        the <i>RealGrammar</i>.
