/**
 * <p>
 *    This interface specifies the functions necessary to parse a generic expression
 *    into a tree of tokens. The methods specify the operators, the parentheticals,
 *    the functions, and the constants in the grammar. Other methods specify whether
 *    tokens are case-sensitive or not, and also specify any synonyms that should be
 *    built-in to the grammar.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *    Any class that implements this interface should be able to be passed into
 *    the <code>parseTree</code> method in <code>Parser</code>
 *    in order to construct a <i>token tree</i> in the form of a <code>TokenNode</code>.
 *    A <code>SemanticTreeBuilder</code> is then required to convert the token tree
 *    into a <i>semantic tree</i> which permits evaluation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *    Multiple grammmars may be combined in order to parse an expression... generally
 *    this will be done. This also permits grammars to be dynamically adjusted.
 * </p>
