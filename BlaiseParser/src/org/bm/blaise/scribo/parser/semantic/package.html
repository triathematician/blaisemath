        This package consists of classes that are useful for generating semantic trees.
        Generally the implementation is <i>abstract</i>, so that further classes are required
        to actually parse a semantic tree. The main entry point is <code>SemanticTreeBuilder</code>,
        which converts a <i>"token tree"</i>, in which the structure of the tree is known but not
        the meaning, into a <i>"semantic tree"</i>, in which the nodes are all mapped to some sort
        of "meaning". Classes that build trees of different types should implement
        <code>SemanticTreeBuilder</code> in order to implement the semantic meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
        The semantic tree is a combination of <code>SemanticNode</code>'s, which may have dynamic
        type parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Errors in evaluation are handled by the <code>SemanticTreeEvaluationException</code>.
