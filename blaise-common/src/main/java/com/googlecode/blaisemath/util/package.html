            General purpose utility classes used throughout the BlaiseGraphics library.
        </p>
        <h1>Threads and Concurrency</h1>
        <p>
            Most classes in <i>BlaiseCommon</i> are not designed for multi-threading.
            Exceptions are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.util.coordinate.CoordinateManager},
            a thread-safe object for managing a collection of object locations.
            </li>
            <li>
            {@link com.googlecode.blaisemath.util.swing.AnimationStep},
            which launches a background thread for animation effects. The class
            contains a static {@code ScheduledExecutorService}, and the static method
            {@code runNTimes()} can be used to run animations using that service.
            </li>
        </ul>
