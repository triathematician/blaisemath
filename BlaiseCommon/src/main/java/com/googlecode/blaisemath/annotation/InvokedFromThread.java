/**
 * <p>
 * This annotation is used to document information about the thread(s) that will
 * be invoking a method. Typical values used include "{@code EDT}" for the swing
 * event-dispatch thread, "{@code multiple}" where the method may be called from
 * multiple threads, or "{@code unknown}" where the thread calling the method is
 * not known. Other values can also be used. This annotation generally "propagates"
 * in two ways. If a method has an {@code InvokedFromThread} annotation, any
 * overriding methods should have the same annotation, and any other methods
 * called within that method should have the annotation (although the scope might
 * be widened, e.g. moving from {@code InvokedFromThread("my-thread")} to
 * {@code InvokedFromThread("unknown")}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This annotation is only intended to be applied where the thread is not
 * understood from context, or when invalid assumptions might be made. Thread-safe
 * classes, for example, have methods assumed to be accessible from arbitrary
 * threads, and don't need to be annotated. However, any other method invoked
 * within one of those methods might have the annotation {@code InvokedFromThread("multiple")}
 * or {@code InvokedFromThread("unknown")}.
