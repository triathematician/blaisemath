          The <code>scio.coordinate.formal</code> package consists of formal mathematical descriptions of
          coordinate spaces, e.g. metric spaces, vector spaces, and inner product spaces, expressed in terms
          of their mathematical definitions. This should eventually be moved to another utility library.
